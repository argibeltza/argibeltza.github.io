This machine is easy to tryhackme in difficulty.

## Step 1

To perform the scan we will need the **nmap** tool and the **IP of the machine to attack**.

## Step 2

We used **Gobuster** to discover hidden directories of the website.

It has found a directory called **protected**.

If we search in the other directories, we might come across a user named Bob in the **guidelines** directory

## Step 3

We can use **Hydra** to find Bob's password on the page with simple protection

If we log in to the protected page, we can see that it has moved to another port (1234), as observed in the Nmap scan.

## Step 4

We are **searching** for an **exploit** using the msfconsole tool for Tomcat. In my case, I will use **'use multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload'**.

We need to add the necessary parameters to use the exploit **(Rhosts, Rport, HttpUsername, HttpPassword)**.

## Step 5

Once exploited, we will **get a shell** on the attacked machine, and from here, we can access the root folder to view the **root's flag**.

## Step 6

With this, we have completed the toolsRus machine on TryHackMe.
