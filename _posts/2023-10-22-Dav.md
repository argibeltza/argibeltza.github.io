This machine is easy to tryhackme in difficulty.

## Step 1

To perform the scan we will need the **nmap** tool and the **IP of the machine to attack**.

## Step 2

We used **Gobuster** to discover hidden directories of the website.

It has found a directory called **Webdav**. 

## Step 3

Its protected by a login, if we search we can find the **default credentials.**

## Step 4

Once inside we look for a file to upload to the server that allows us to make a **remote shell**.

We will need to **change** the ip of the script to **our ip**

Once this is done we will have to upload the file to the server to do this we will use the curl command **(curl -T $FILE -u $USER:$PASS $SERVER URL)**

## Step 6

We **start the script** by clicking on it.

And with **nc** we use it to find the shell that is being sent through **port 1234**.

## Step 7

Now that we are inside we go to the user's /home to get the user's **first flag**.

## Step 8

With the command **sudo -l** we see that the user with whom we have connected can use the **cat command** with **sudo without password**.

So we will perform a **sudo cat** of the **root user's flag file**.

## Step 9

With this, we have completed the toolsRus machine on TryHackMe.
