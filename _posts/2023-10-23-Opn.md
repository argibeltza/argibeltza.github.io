On this page I will explain how to bypass OPN of the routers, for this we will need 3 only requirements

![](/assets/images/Opn/logo.PNG)

Requirements:

1-Kali linux or wifislax

2-Access point

3-Card with the possibility of monitor mode

## Step 1

The first step will be to **turn off the Wi-Fi** adapter to put it in **monitor** mode, to do this we will use the following 2 commands.

When we have entered these two commands, the monitor mode should appear in the configuration of the correct adapter.

To finish this first step we will have to **turn on** the adapter again.

## Step 2

With the command **airodump-ng** we will listen to the network and look for a network that has **OPN**.

## Step 3

We will have to keep the channel and its mac address to use the airodump command **(airodump-ng --bssid "mac" -channel "channel number" --write "name of file to send to" interface).**

To wait less time we can cause movements in the network with the following command **(aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b "mac" -h "our mac")** for our mac it is advisable to use the macchange command.

## Step 4

Finally, when we have 30,000 data collected, we can carry out the statistics attack with the next command **aircrack command "filename.cap"**.
