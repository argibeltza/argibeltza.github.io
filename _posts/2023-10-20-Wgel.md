This machine is easy to tryhackme in difficulty.

## Step 1

To perform the scan we will need the **nmap** tool and the **IP of the machine to attack**.

## Step 2

We used **Gobuster** to discover hidden directories of the website.

It has found a directory called **sitemap**, so we use Gobuster once again.

## Step 3

We started to view the most important found pages, first we can see an user in the **main page** (source code).

**We found the user** but we need a password, if we go to the ./ssh page we can saw a **id_rsa key** for that user.

## Step 4

We can copy the key into a file named 'id_rsa'.

We change the permissions of the previously created file to 600 using **'chmod 600 "file"'** and attempt to connect using the **'ssh jessie@ip -i id_rsa'** command in order to log in with the discovered key.

## Step 5

We are now inside the machine. The first step is to determine which **user** we are and our **current location**.

While exploring the home directory of the user 'jessie,' we came across the first flag in the **Documents folder**

## Step 6

To find the next flag, we need to check the permissions of this user using the **'sudo -l'** command.

![](![](/assets/images/Wgel/W-9.PNG)) 

We observe that the user can execute the **'wget'** command with sudo from the directory **'/usr/bin/wget'**.

## Step 7

To leverage these permissions, we set our machine to listen on port 1234 **(nc -lnvp 1234)**, and from the other machine, we send the root user's flag to our machine on port 1234.

## Step 8

With this, we have completed the Wgel CTF machine on TryHackMe.

I hope it has been helpful to you :D. **Argibeltza 10/21/2023**
