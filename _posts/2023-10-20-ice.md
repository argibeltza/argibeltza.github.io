This machine is easy to tryhackme in difficulty.

## Step 1

The first step to start this machine, as in most, is to perform an nmap to see the ports it has open. 

To perform the scan we will need the **nmap** tool and the **IP of the machine to attack**.

## Step 2

Once the scan is finished we see the versions and programs that the Windows machine uses in this case. Searching in cvedetails we found a vulnerability in **icecast** with a score of **7.5**.

This vulnerability is a code execution overflow.

## Step 3

Once the previous vulnerability is found, we will search in metasploit for an exploit for that vulnerability, to do this we will use the **“msfconsole”** command.

We found an exploit with that vulnerability with a very good range.

## Step 4

Now that we have found the exploit we mark it and see what parameters it needs for the exploit to work (**use 0** to select the exploit and **info** to see the necessary parameters).

We put the **Rhosts** ip (set rhosts "ip") of the machine to attack (10.10.42.252 in my case) and we exploit.

## Step 5

Once the machine has been exploited, we have gained access to the machine. Once access has been gained, the first step is to **locate the user** with whom we have obtained a shell.

Then we will have to see what Windows we have, version and architecture.

## Step 6

Now that we know the architecture of Windows, we use the command **'run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester'** to see if it is vulnerable.

We see how it has found vulnerability in **exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr** with 41 different exploits to compromise the machine.

## Step 7

To use these exploits we need to have the shell in the **background**.

Once we have it in the background we look for the exploit found previously in msfconsole **'use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr'**

![](\assets\images\ICE\ICE-7.2.PNG) 

Now we will have to configure the **LHOST** for the exploit to work correctly.

## Step 8

With the **'getprivs'** command we have the list of permissions we have, we can see how we have permissions on the files.

## Step 9

We look at the processes to see if there is a process to generate a shell with the system user (with the **ps command**).

![](\assets\images\ICE\ICE-9.PNG) 

We find the **spoolsv.exe** process, to change from shell to system we will have to migrate with the command **'migrate -N PID'**

## Step 10

We **load kiwi** (updated version of mimikatz) to download passwords, we look at the options it has using the help command.

![](\assets\images\ICE\ICE-10.PNG) 

We run the **'creds_all'** command to steal all the passwords from memory.

## Step 11

In the help menu we can see **different commands:**

With the hashdump command we see all the hashes on the machine.

With the **'screenshare'** command we can see the attacked machine live.

![](\assets\images\ICE\ICE-11.2.PNG) 

With the **'record_mic'** command we can record from the microphone of the attacked machine.

With the **'timestomp'** command we can modify the timestamps of system files.

With the **'golden_ticket_create'** command it allows us to perform golden attacks with which we can maintain persistence and authenticate as any user of the domain.

## Step 12

With this we have finished making the tryhackme ICE machine.

I hope it has been helpful to you :D. **Argibeltza 10/20/2023**
