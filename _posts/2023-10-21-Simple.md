This machine is easy to tryhackme in difficulty.

## Step 1

To perform the scan we will need the **nmap** tool and the **IP of the machine to attack**.

If we use the parameters **-sVC** in Nmap, we can see that port **2222** is SSH.

## Step 2

We used **Gobuster** to discover hidden directories of the website.

It has found a directory called **Simple** in that directory we can find the version of the CMS **(2.2.8)**.

## Step 3

We can look for a **CVE associated** with that version of the CMS.

We found an **exploit** for that version and CVE on the **Exploit Database**.

We copy the exploit to a file on our machine and execute it.

## Step 4

We initiate an SSH session with the username and password obtained by the previous script on **port 2222**.

Once inside, we can see the flag of the regular user.

## Step 5

To escalate privileges, we use **'sudo -l'** and see that there's passwordless sudo access to Vim. We search on the **GTFOBins website** and find that using the command **'sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh''** gives us a **root shell**.

## Step 6

With this, we have completed the Simple machine on TryHackMe.

I hope it has been helpful to you :D. **Argibeltza 10/21/2023**
